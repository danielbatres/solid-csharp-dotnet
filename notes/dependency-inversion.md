# Dependency inversion principle

* Seeks to decouple application components
* Help us make changes affecting the code as little as possible
* Must be implemented with abstract types
* There are 3 types of dependency injection, by constructor, by property and by parameter
* Constructor dependency is the most common

Dependency injection is essential to be able to apply the test driven development (TDD) methodology.
