# Single responsability principle

Distributes responsabilities among different components within a system, where each component has a unique responsability.

Applies to modules, classes, methods and functions

### Example

As a user after confirming the purchase I expect to see a **confirmation message**,<br>
have the posibility to **download the invoice** and a **confirmation email**.
